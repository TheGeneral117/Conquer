Purpose

To develop reliable and maintainable applications, you must follow coding standards and best practices.

The naming conventions, coding standards and best practices described in this document are compiled from our own experience

All team members are always expected to follow the coding standards and best practices.


Commenting standards

	File header expectation
	
		Example: //<Filename>

	Method heading expectation
	
		Example: //Explanation of what the method does
			 //What the parameters of the function are

	Code block expectation
	
		Example: //Explanation of what the code block is supposed to do


Naming convention

	Meaningful, descriptive words to name variables.
	Good:
		string CharacterName;
		int Row, Column;
		GameObject SpawnedItem;

	Not Good:
		string nam;
		int i,j;
		GameObject temp;

	Capitalization expectation
	
		Example: Pascal Casing for functions, Camel Casing for variables
			void ReadName(), int weaponDamage
		
	Standard Prefixing 
	
		Example: For parameter variables use underscore
			void ReadName(string _name)
		
	Abbreviation use 
	
		Example: Allowed if variable is discernable
		

File Formatting


Indentation and Spacing

	Indenting standard
	
		Example: crtl K+D will format the document
		
	Curly braces ( {} ) format
	
		Example: void ReadName()
			 {
			   //function 
			 }
		
	Blank line expectation
	
		Example: Two new lines between chunks of code
		
	Spacing around operators
	
		Example: space before and after operator
			1 + 1

	
Programming practices

	Maximum characters per line
	
		Example: Don't let the characters fill the screen
		
	Maximum nested conditions 
	
		Example: 3 maximum nested conditions
		
	Maximum lines per method
	
		Example: As many as needed
		
	#region usage
	
		Example: not needed
		
	Static values (hardcoded numbers. Const variables, and #defines)
	
		Example: certain things will be hardcoded
